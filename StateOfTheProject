So you will probably have to get newversions of all these files.You can forestall the inevitable by just checking out the change logand updating each new file one by one, but I highly recommend just startingfrom scratch as soon as is convenient.  You can start by copying the folderUnused:Start Here:WebTV: from the the Unused: volume of MacServer.Sorry for the inconvenience.-Phil__________________________Wednesday, March 27, 1996 2:21:33 PMAdded GooberTerm code & app to the Tools project in a subproject "GooberTerm"You'll need to re-mount the project for it to show up.NOTE : this app must be in the same directory as your ROM images to work (I'll fixit when I get a chance).-tim__________________________Wednesday, March 27, 1996 8:38:53 AMHad to check in a new :Content:ROM Store, so you will have to deleteyours before checking out a new version:delete "{WTV:}Content:ROM Store"-John__________________________Monday, March 18, 1996 9:52:45 AMAdded BoxPrintDebug.c to the projects.-John__________________________Sunday, March 17, 1996 4:58:09 PMYou'll want to add BoxPrintDebug.c to the "Debug" portion of yourWebTV project(s).  There's a BoxPrintDebug trial menu item in theFunctions menu.  If you try typing in an address and a type, like"0x342442 Network", it'll try to call a print method on the objectat 0x342442.  Beware, of course, that if the object at that locationisn't a Network, you could hose yourself, since the print method mayneed to call virtual functions to print itself out.

It contains the following items:	• “Update Active Window from Unix”:		This will bring the active window contents down from		the equivalent file in the unix folder.  This is not		commonly used.			• “Send Active Window to Unix” (also triggered by cmd-U):		This will push the contents of the frontmost window		to the equivalent file in the unix folder.  This is		useful if you wish to edit in MPW but build with unix.		You have to be very careful to remember to use this		or type cmd-U, otherwise the build will just build		from the same old sources on Unix.			• “Backup to Unix”:		This will back up all newer files to the unix folder.		Be careful about this for now, because cap (the		software that allows us to mount unix directories as		AppleShare volumes) may have bugs converting mod dates.To use this menu you will have to set and export the following variables:		{UnixUser}        The user name of your unix account.	{UnixPassword}    The password of your unix account.  If you	                  do not set this you will be prompted.	{UnixMachine:}    The appleshare name of the machine that has	                  your home directory.  The default is :mandarin:.					  If we go to multiple appletalk zones then					  this will be <zone name>:<machine name>.	{UnixVolume:}     The name of the appleshare volume.  The	                  default is "{UnixUser}:".	{UnixWTV:}        The path name of the WebTV folder in your	                  account.  The default is {UnixVolume:}WebTV:.		There are many incompatibilities between MPW and cap, and some maystill be exposed.  Let me know if you see problems.-Phil__________________________Wednesday, February 28, 1996 14:29:00 PMChanged the WebTVπPPC and WebTVπPPCNoDebug projects to allow optimal sizes for enum types. This means most enums are now only a char rather than a long. This affects the size of values savedin the the "WebTV Preferences" file, making old preference files incompatible.

Currently these are NOT on rotary.  We've requested pacbellto make them hunt, and they are working on it.  If you get a busy signal,try a different number.  These numbers will be phased out and used forsomething else when pacbell installs an additional T1 for local loop (March 5th,see below).	415 326-0685	415 326-0498    415 326-0499	415 326-0419MCI 800 number.  We get charged .08/minute for use of this group.  It should beused to test registration scripts, etc.  Stuff that has to be perfect for theproduction system, or the trial.  There are 24 trunks starting at 800 613-8199.This will be the number the clients use for registration.  It just so happensthat it will work for demos, etc. when you're on the road.  This is a good numberto use when you're demoing from a hotel, or somewhere else where the charge youup the butt for reselling LD services.Pacbell local loop T1:  415 329-0511 -- 24 lines.  This is good for dialing fromyour desks, or from the conference room for demos.  This number will be installedand active around March 5th.------------When using any of these numbers, you can login with your normal mandarin user idand password.  The one drawback is that you can't have multiple logins under thesame name at the same time.  That means using your username for demos is a badidea, because there might be two demos at the same time.  One of them won'tconnect.The solution for demos is a special account called "demo" and the password of "WebTV".You can set MacPPP to use this name and password, along with one of the numberlisted above.- Rubin__________________________Friday, February 23, 1996 02:12:06 AMWe had some problems with the ROM:Images project this morning.

If there is codethat is not functional on the hardware, but is on the simulator, it should be #ifdef'dout with another (temporary) flag that only gets defined if HARDWARE is true - for example,TCP is currently not working on the real hardware, so there is a NO_TCP flag that is onlydefined when HARDWARE is.  To simulate the conditions on the real hardware, you just need todefine NO_TCP, not HARDWARE.-tim__________________________Thursday, February 8, 1996 9:08:23 PMMight I suggest occasionally throwing out your "WebTV Preferences" and startingagain from scratch?  The simulator used to leave the preferences resource fileopen all the time, and if your machine crashed or otherwise corrupted the preferencesfile, reopening it could seriously disturb the simulator.In this latest checkin, preferences code has been changed to open/close thepreference file on demand when you need data but otherwise leave it CLOSED.However, this doesn't guarantee the safety of the preferences file, and(as Mac discovered) there's nothing to warn you that the preferences fileis corrupted, so throwing out your preferences isn't a bad idea for the healthof the simulator.Mick.__________________________Thursday, January 25, 1996 4:28:23 AMHere are the key mappings to remote buttons for the simulator.

Document.c (in the HTML project)was corrupted because the MacServer crashed during a checkin. Fortunately, Dave hadan uncorrupted version of the file, but the change history is still corrupt in the database for that file. I checked in the fresh copy on top of the old version.What this means is that if we want to get back to an earlier version of the software, we  must fix up Document.c. Cary copied last Saturday's version of the projector  database onto the MacServer. It might be possible to put the Document.c version history back together again using the older database if we decidethat's a priority.--Chris__________________________Monday, January 22, 1996 4:20:55 PMThe Box projector database got hosed last night.

(I believe) I'vechanged all project headers to have guards in the following format:__RANDOMHEADER_H__ "RandomHeader.h"Note two underscores at the beginning and end, and underscores wherepunctuation would normally lie.  Headers from Plauger or other externalsources is as per their respective standards.  I've also changed thecontent of the header files themselves to look like this:#ifndef __FOO_H__#define __FOO_H__	// contents of Foo.h go here#else#error "Attempted to #include Foo.h multiple times"#endifThe intention is to warn us when we're unnecessarily includingredundant files (and hence slowing down the compile for no goodreason).Mick.__________________________Wednesday, January 17, 1996 1:01:43 PMWe now have a way to provide (often) fast temporary memory allocation.  The calls areAllocateBuffer(size) and FreeBuffer(bufferPtr, size).  They use alloca when it isavailable, but above a certain size (256 bytes) they do explicit allocation anddeallocation.  This allows us to have fast access but still be flexible to deal witharbitrarily large objects, an example being a very very long string.It turns out that alloca is implemented for the PPC CW builds by providingspace in the system heap, inside a non-relocatable CW block!  I have not yetpushed it to see how it deals with multiple outstanding alloca's per routine, nor do I understand yet where deallocation happens.I will talk to Pascal and Joe to see if alloca is supported for MIPS, and wheredeallocation happens in general.-Phil__________________________Saturday, January 13, 1996 7:28:44 PMEverything in WebTV Settings should be old and unused, now.

You'llneed AppleScript turned on to make use of this feature. Here's what to do:Select "Test Includes" from the menu.	- This will create the needed test files and launch "Script Editor"Select the "Run" button.	- This will launch CodeWarrior and build the test project. You may need to tell	Script Editor where CodeWarrior is.Examine the project for errors.	- To make life interesting, the currently checked in includes have 3 errors. Two are	probably insignificant, and indicate files that need to be marked as obsolete in	projector. The third error is the kind we are looking for.	- one significant error is when the bottom of the project does not read "xx file(s) 0 0";	the non-zero values say that an include is generating code. Find the offending file in 	the project. Open the test file, and disassemble its contents. It will usually expose	a class that is derived from a base with a virtual destructor, that in turn does not	define a destructor.	-Cary__________________________Tuesday, December 19, 1995 1:36:18 AMYou may notice that your remote window does not come upwhen you start up the simulator.  This is because I addedan extra parameter to the WebTV Settings file that determinesif the remote window is being used or not.If you type cmd-N you will get a new one and the simulatorwill remember if it is open or not.-Phil__________________________Wednesday, December 13, 1995 2:06:01 PMYou can find source changes that break the MPW embedded build more quickly by usingAppleScript. Here's how:- update to the latest sources- install Applescript if you haven't already- open "{WTV:}Tools:Build WebTV Script" (using the Script Editor)- change the first line to reflect where your WebTV: folder is- select "Save As Run Only" from the File menu- select the "Kind: Application" popup- select "Never Show Startup Screen" - save the file in your MPW.local folder, or somewhere else outside of the WebTV: projectThen, from the Finder or MPW, execute the application you just saved.It may then ask you to find CodeWarrior for it. If you got up on the right side of bed, theapplication will then build ka9qπPPC, WebTVπIDT-PPC, WebTVπPPC and WebTVπ as needed.Caveats:- just because ka9qπPPC and WebTVπIDT-PPC build doesn't mean that IDT-MPW will build. The   worst bug I've found so far is that // comments on a #if line may cause the preprocessor  directive to be ignored.- I didn't add a MPW menu command to run the script because I'm lazy.- I'm not smart enough to write AppleScript so that it can find WebTV for you.- Full warnings are turned on in the PPC and WebTVπIDT-PPC projects (hint, hint)- The real MIPS projects (coming soon) will be real close to the PPC projects, maybe.__________________________Tuesday, December 12, 1995 2:20:43 PMVerifySources and friends are now ready for prime-time. Recent changes include:- temporary files are placed in "{WTV:}Temporary:" (Please put your temporary files there.)- the "Modify Resources" and "Modify CW Projects" properly add those files to the change log.- fonts and graphics that have been locally edited are now detected; the merge-in  command for these, generated by VerifySources is "ForceNewRevision" (Bruce named)- the "compute version number" hopefully works better- a new command UpdateToLatest does a command line version of "Update Active To Latest"known bugs (feel free to fix them if they are yours)- occasionally StreamEdit fails to create a file, usually "commandList". Rerunning   VerifySources seems to work OK.- existing scripts like Merge In are still enabled but don't do the right things.- running WebTV or building the MPW embedded build litter temporary or log files.- the same file may show up in the ChangeLog more than once if the version changed.__________________________Monday, December 11, 1995 2:20:15 PMThe Metrowerks embedded build is coming soon. To speed it and the MPW build, I made a number of simplifications to the includes. If I did bad, please let meknow and I will return things to their pristine state.- Classes.h no longer contains class declarations- The WebTV project doesn't need precompiled headers- The sources compile without any nonstandard C++ extensions enabled- Debugger() got renamed to DebugBreak() (Sorry, Phil)- Macintosh structs referred to by general includes now refer to abstract structs- There's still a Headers.h, but it doesn't (so) have much in it--Cary__________________________Monday, December 11, 1995 2:01:46 AMYou may have a problem checking out the file "WebTV:ROM:Images:ControlPanel.gif". You should delete the file, and then check out.

There is now a new debugging call:		NoteObserving(void* pointee, void* pointer, char* fieldName)		   You can use it to make sure that if a field is pointing to another   object then the object in question never slips out from underneath   without notice (e.g. on a FreeMemory() or ReallocateMemory() call).   The tagged memory manager enforces this.      Take a look at Status.c for an example.2. I made the memory verification now happen only when strict debugging   is chosen in the Debug menu.  It was too slow during parsing.  I   suspect that we are creating and destroying a huge number of temp   objects that we were not previously.   - Phil__________________________Wednesday, November 1, 1995 2:48:38 PMProjector is confused about :Interfaces:Control.h. You must deleteyour :Interfaces:Control.h by hand before you check out.-John__________________________Sunday, October 29, 1995 6:01:35 PMI added the file {WTV:}Documentation:Bugs.  When you find abug that is not merely missing functionality, could you takethe time to MRO the file and add it to the appropriatesection?  The obvious addition here is to add web pagesthat kill the browser or cause a mis-parse.I’m starting to look for a bug tracking system, so this documentis only a short-term solution.  If you have had good experiencesusing a particular bugbase and client in the past, please letme know.-Phil__________________________Saturday, October 28, 1995 4:58:00 AMYou can now do some simple memory differencing, using new itemsin the Debugging menu.The "Memory Checkpoint" item takes a snaphotof the mallocator and spits it out in a nice format to a filecalled "Memory Checkpoint" in {WTV:}.The "Memory Difference" menu item will print out another memorydump (a la Memory Checkpoint") and then show new or changed blocks,and then it will show blocks that still exist from the originalcheckpoint.  This will al be saved to a file called ""Memory Difference",and when the menu item is selected again the info will be savedin "Memory Difference 2", "Memory Difference 3", etc.Please let me know if you have suggestions on how to improvethe memory differencing tools.  Here are the improvements Ialready have planned:	1. Printout of blocks from “dead” URLs.	2. Better tagged of currently untagged blocks.	3. A file naming scheme that lets the differencing	   run across executions of the simulator w/out	   overwriting.-Phil__________________________Friday, October 27, 1995 5:41:29 PMThere are two new menu items in the WebTV menu:- Build ROM Store- Update ROM StoreYou should use 'Build ROM Store' after you make changes to the contentsof the WebTV:ROM: directory. After doing this, test the simulator with'Use ROM Store' checked. If that works, use the 'Update ROM Store' menuto make your version of the ROM store ready to check in.'Update ROM Store' moves your version of the ROM Store into WebTV:Content:ROM:and makes the file ModifyReadOnly so that when you MergeIn it will be checked into the project.These menu items will be removed when this process becomes automatic.--Chris__________________________Friday, October 20, 1995 4:19:51 PMIf you’re having problems starting the SImulator, you may have an old versionof the "ROM Store" file in your {WTV:} folder.  Throw it away and try again.-Phil__________________________Thursday, October 19, 1995 6:20:18 AMThere is now a copy of the ROM Store file checked into the Contentsubfolder.  The Simulator will look for ":ROM Store" and then":Content:ROM Store:", in that order.  The former is created bythe MPW build and the latter comes from projector.-Phil__________________________Monday, October 16, 1995 1:04:46 PMThe browser is ported.  It is built for theembedded target and boots halfway on theIDT board.You can now build for the IDT board (soon to be namedthe IDev board).  Just select the “IDT Builds” item inthe web menu in MPW and it will retarget for the board.If you have any problems with the build let me know.Joe and I will soon integrate the browser with theplatform and boot for real.For now I am including an option in the PersonalDaemonto build for the embedded target too.-Phil__________________________Saturday, October 14, 1995 8:41:38 PMThere is a new project called WebTV∫Sound∫. You will need to remount WebTV∫to get this new project, which can be done by using the unmountprojectcommand or by simply quitting and restarting MPW and choosing the Mount WebTVmenu.-John (for Phil)__________________________Friday, October 6, 1995 4:24:20 AMTurn on the "Back Buffer" menu option or you will crash booting up.-Phil__________________________Sunday, October 1, 1995 11:39:33 PMAs you go crusing around the net, could you please add tothe collection of web pages in MacServer:LocalNet:  Justuse the Save command in netscape and save each of the images too.If you look in LocalNet you’ll see how it should go.-Phil__________________________Sunday, October 1, 1995 1:02:46 AM1. Take a look at the change log to learn how and why   to use the Local Networking menu item in the simulator.   2. There is now a file called OldChangeLog that contains   all but the most recent of the change log entries.   3. The build platform selection is now done by selecting   an item in the wtv menu.  Right now the only platforms   are Mac and IDt.   -Phil__________________________Tuesday, September 26, 1995 6:55:53 PMThere is a new project called WebTV∫ROM∫.-Phil__________________________Wednesday, September 20, 1995 2:33:54 PMThis should now appear automatically.-Phil__________________________Thursday, September 21, 1995 2:41:21 AMTake a look at :Documentation:QuoteBook__________________________Monday, September 18, 1995 10:13:18 AMI created a project on the server in ":MacServer:Sources:Basic" tocontain the source to Peter Barrett's "Basic" browser. The UserStartupis in ":MacServer:Sources:Startup Scripts:UserStartup•Basic".Because Peter plans to continue to make changes, this version of thesource should be considered a snapshot of his version, not a versionthat we can modify.John__________________________Friday, September 1, 1995 5:09:56 AMThis file contains important information about the currentstate of the project and sources.  It will be displayed foreveryone when it is modified.-Phil
