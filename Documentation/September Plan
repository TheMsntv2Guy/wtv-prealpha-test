This is a brief description of the plan for September for the Browser, along
with specific tasks and milestones.


We are planning to achieve the following:
	1. A stable, functional Browser running on the Mac.
	2. A text-only version of the Browser running on the hardware.

If we overachieve we can consider the following goal too:
	3. A stable, functional Browser running on the hardware.

	
We have broken the system into 3 major pieces: Browser, Platform, and Tools.
John and Chris have responsibility for the Browser, but will offload pieces
as necessary.  Phil, Joe, and Bruce have responsibility for the platform,
and will divide the work as follows:

	Memory Management:		Phil
	Graphics:				Bruce
	TCP:					Joe
	Debug:					Phil
	Serial IO:				Joe
	User Input:				Phil
	Port:					Joe


Lee and Phil will work on the tools.  The principal task is to get
gdb on the Mac talking to the hardware.


Here are the milestones:

	Platform Interfaces defined:			9/18
	Browser limping on Mac					9/22
	Browser stable, extended				9/30
	Tools fully functional					9/30
	Text-only port							9/30
