This document reflects the responsibilities for each of the software team members
for the WebTV system software pieces.  

The software is split into two major pieces of functionality: Application and Platform.
The Platform code is low-level system software dealing with hardware control, memory,
processor management, etc.  It is written primarily in C.  Portions of it are dependent
on the specifics of the embedded hardware.

The application is platform-independent; it is built against the well defined program
interfaces defined by the Platform.  The app is written in C++ as a set of cooperating
classes.

This document defines the software at the next level of granularity.  We have defined
each of the major platform and application pieces, and the person reponsible for them
(or TBD).  We have mapped these pieces againt the release schedule, in order to provide
a place to map out the evolution of the individual pieces over time.

We are currently focused on the October 31 release.
