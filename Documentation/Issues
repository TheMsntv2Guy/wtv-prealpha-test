Open Issues
-----------------
Client pull is specified by
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="5; URL=index.html">
which seems to imply that 'MIME header like' info can be specified in the
HTML content.  Is this generally true?  Do we need to support the refresh
command at the HTTP level as well as its META incarnation?  Can other HTTP
info appear in the HTML body?  What about EXPIRES, can it be in the body?
