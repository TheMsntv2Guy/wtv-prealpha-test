<H1>Implementation of the HTTP Client</H1>

<HR>

This document describes the current implementation of the <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">HTTP Protocol</A> as from
version 3.0 (unreleased, August 1994) of the <A
HREF="../../Status.html">Library of Common Code</A> (see <A
HREF="../../Implementation/Version.make"> current version
number</A>). The HTTP client is based on the HTTP 1.0 specification
but is backwards compatible with the 0.9 version. The major difference
between the implementation before version 3.0 is that this version is
a state machine based on the state diagram illustrated below.  The
advantage of this approach will become obvious in the section on <A
HREF="multithread.html">Multithreaded Clients</A> even though the
HTTP protocol is stateless by nature.

<P><IMG SRC="HTTP.gif"> <P>

The individual states and the transitions between them are explained
in the following sections. Note the difference in notation between the
<EM>client</EM> (client side application built un top of the library)
and <EM>HTTP Client</EM> that is the protocol module in the library.

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="initial">BEGIN State</A>

<DD> This state is the idle state or initial state where the HTTP
client awaits a new request passed from the client. If the user at
this point has typed in a userid and a passwd for <A
HREF="../../../AccessAuthorization/Overview.html"> access
authorization</A> the HTTP client also prepares the <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers#z9"> Authorization
header</A>.

<A NAME="connect"><DT> NEED_CONNECTION State</A>

<DD> The HTTP client is now ready for setting up a connection to the
remote host. The connection is always initiated by a <EM>connect</EM>
system call. In order to minimize the access to the Domain Name
Server, all host names to previous visited hosts no matter of the <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/URL/4.1_Schemes.html"> access schemes</A>
used) are stored in a local host cache. The cache handles multi-homed
hosts in a special way in that it measures the time it takes to
actually make a connection to one of the IP-addresses.  This time is
stored together with the specific IP-address and the hostname in the
cache and on the next connection to the same host the IP-address with
the fastest connect time is chosen.

<DT> NEED_REQUEST State

<DD> The <A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/Request.html">HTTP
Request</A> is what the client sends to the remote HTTP server just
after the establishment of the connection. The request consists of a
HTTP header line, a set of MIME Headers, and possibly a data object to
be posted to the server. The header line has the following format:

<PRE>
	&lt;<A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/Methods.html#">METHOD</A>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="ftp://nic.ddn.mil/rfc/rfc1630.txt">URI</A>&gt; &lt;HTTP-VERSION&gt; CRLF
</PRE>
 
Current methods supported in the clients are

<DL>

<DT> <A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/Methods.html#z47">GET</A>

<DD> This is for requesting a URI or for specifying a <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/Methods/GetSearches.html">
text search</A>. Text searches are initiated by placing a "?" in the URI.

<DT> <A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/Methods.html#z47">HEAD</A>

<DD> The HEAD method is equivalent to GET in the sense that it is
requesting a URI at the remote server. The difference is that the
server only returns the HTTP headers but no data object. This is used
for updating cache information, getting information on the size of the
data object (or body) etc.

</DL>

In the section on <A HREF="ClientPost.html">Put and Post</A> the
implementation of the client interface to the library is described.
However, the actual implementation of <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/Methods.html#z53"> PUT</A> and <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/Methods/Post.html">POST</A> in the HTTP
protocol is yet to be specified. The reason is that the current
specification is limited and does not allow the HTTP protocol to be a
superset of existent Internet Presentation Protocols.<P>

The HTTP headers are as mentioned a set of MIME headers even though they are
not all officially accepted by the MIME specifications. The HTTP client
supports the following headers:

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z3">Accept:</A>

<DD> The current implementation uses one accept line for each
MIME-type supported by the client. For advanced clients this means
that the "Accept: " sequence is repeated 20-30 times which gives a
overhead of 200-300 bytes per request (including the CRLF telnet
EOL-sequence). This should be changed so that either a comma separated
list is transmitted instead or only the MIME content types without any
subtypes.

<DT><A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z14">Referer:</A>

<DD> If any parent anchor is known to the requested URI this is send
in the referer field. This is to let the server know what link has led
to the current request. Nothing is sent if the parent anchor is
unknown or does not exist.

<DT> <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#from">From:</A>

<DD> The full email address is sent along the request. It is meant as
an informative service to the recipient and can be changed to any
value the user wishes to sign the request with. As it is possible to
manipulate the email address, this field can not be used for any
security verification or precaution.

<DT> <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#user-agent">User-Agent:</A>

<DD> The user agent is by many clients currently generated in a
somewhat verbose format. The goal is to make this field machine
readable so it can be used on the server side to perform individual
actions as a function of the client version. As a side effect it can
also be used for statistics etc.

<DT> <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z9">Authorization:</A>

<DD> The authorization header as introduced in the <A
HREF="#connect">NEED_CONNECTION state</A>. 
</DL>

<DT> SENT_REQUEST State

<DD> When the request is sent the client waits until a response is
given from the server or the connection is timed out in case or an
error situation. As the client does not know whereas the remote server
is a HTTP 0.9 server or a HTTP 1.0 it must look at the first part of
the response to figure out what version of HTTP is returned. The
reason is that the HTTP protocol 0.9 does not contain a HTTP header
line in the response. It simply starts to send the requested data
object as soon as the GET request is handled. Future versions of the
HTTP protocol will all contain a header line with the protocol version
like the MIME protocol.

<DT> NEED_ACCESS_AUTHORIZATION State

<DD> If a <A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html">401
Unauthorized</A> status code is returned the client asks the user for
a user id and a password, see also the <A
HREF="../../../AccessAuthorization/Overview.html"> Access
Authorization Scheme</A>. The connection is closed before the user is
asked for the userid and password so any new request initiated upon a
<A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html">401 status code</A>
causes a new connection to be established.

<DT> REDIRECTION State

<DD> The remote server returns a redirection <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html">status code</A> if the URI
has either been moved temporaryly or permanent to another location,
possibly on another HTTP server or any other server supported by the
WWW-model. The HTTP Client supports both a temporaryly and a permanent
redirection code returned from the server:

<DL>

<DT> <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html#z8">
301 Moved</A>

<DD> The load procedure is recursively called on a 301 redirection
code. The new URI is parsed back to the user as information via the <A
HREF="../../../Library/Implementation/HTError.html">
Error and Information module</A>, and a new request generated. The new
request can be of any <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/URL/4_1_Schemes.html">access
scheme</A> accepted in a URI. An upper limit of redirections has been
defined (default to 10) in order to avoid infinite loops.

<DT> <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html#z8">302
Found</A>

<DD> The functionality is the same as for a 301 Moved return status. A
clever client can use the returned URI to change the document in which
the URI originates so that the URI points to the new location.

</DL>

<DD> 

<DT> NO_DATA State

<DD> When a return code indicates that no data object or resource
follows the HTTP headers the HTTP client can terminate the request and
pass control back to the client.

<DT> NEED_BODY State

<DD> If a body is included in the response from the server, the client
must prepare to read the data from the network and direct it to the
destination set up by the client. This is done by setting up a stream
stack with the required conversions.

<DT> GOT_DATA State

<DD> When the data object has been parsed through the stream stack,
the HTTP client terminates the request and handles control back to the
client.

<DT> ERROR or FAILURE State

<DD> If at any point in the request handling a fatal error occurs the
request is aborted and the connection closed. All information about
the error is parsed back to the client via the <A
HREF="../../../Library/Implementation/HTError.html">Error and
Information Module</A>. As the HTTP protocol is stateless, all errors
are fatal between the server and the client. If the erroneous request
is to be repeated, the request starts in the <A
HREF="#initial">initial state</A>.
