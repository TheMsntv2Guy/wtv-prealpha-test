<H1>Multithreaded Clients</H1>

<HR>

This section describes the design and implementation of the
multithreaded, interruptable I/O <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">HTTP</A> Client as it is
implemented in the <A HREF="../../Status.html"> World-Wide Web Library of
Common Code</A>. The section is an extension to the description of the
<A HREF="HTTPFeatures.html">HTTP Client</A> and is divided into the
following sections: <P>

<OL>
<LI> <A HREF="#introduction">Introduction</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#platform">Platform Independent Implementation</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#modes">Modes of Operation</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#datastructures">Control Flow</A>
</OL>

<A NAME="introduction"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>

In a single-process, singlethreaded environment all requests to,
e.g., the I/O interface blocks any further progress in the process.
Any combination of a multiprocess or multithreaded implementation of
the library makes provision for the user of the client application to
request several independent documents at the same time without getting
blocked by slow I/O operations. As a World-Wide Web client is expected
to use much of the execution time doing I/O operation such as
"connect" and "read", a high degree of optimization can be obtained if
multiple threads can run at the same time.<P>

Threads provide a light-weight technique for obtaining an environment
with a multiple set of execution points. A thread is a smaller unit
compared to a process in that it is a single, sequential flow of
control within a process. As mentioned above, when creating a new
process much of the environment does never change and can therefore be
reused. Threads takes the full consequence of this and creates an
environment with multiple execution points within the same
process. Hence threads provide a more lightweight solution than
process forking and this is a part of the reason for their
implementation in the Library of Common Code.

<A NAME="platform"><H2>Platform Independent Implementation</H2></A>

The major concern in the design has been to make an implementation
that is as platform independent as possible. This means that it has
not been possible to use traditional thread packages like DECthreads
which contain a code library with a complete set of thread handling
routines and a consistent user interface. IEEE has publicized the
POSIX standard 1003.4 for multithreaded programming but even this
will eventually limit the portability of the code so that it will not
be usable on small platforms like PCs.<P>

Instead the multithreaded functionality of the HTTP client has been
designed to be used in a single-processor, singlethreaded,
environment as illustrated in the figure.

<P><IMG SRC="SingleStackThread.gif"> <P>

The difference between this technique and "traditional" threads as <A
HREF="#multistackthread">illustrated above</A> is that all information
about a thread is stored in a data object which lives throughout the
lifetime of the thread. This implies that the following rules must be
kept regarding memory management: <P>

<UL> 

<LI> Global variables can be used only if they at all time are
independent of the current state of the active thread.

<LI> Automatic variables can be used only if they are initialized on
every entry to the function and stay state independent of the current
thread throughout their lifetime.

<LI> All information necessary for completing a thread must be kept in
an autonomous data object that is passed round the control flow via the
stack.

</UL>

These rules makes it possible to animate a multithreaded environment
using only one stack without any portability problems as the
implementation is done in plain C on top of the Internet TCP API.


<A NAME="modes"><H2>Modes of Operation</H2></A>

In order to keep the functionality of the HTTP Client as general as
possible, three different modes of operation are implemented. It must
be pointed out that all applications can and are encouraged to use the
<CODE>active mode</CODE>! <P>

<DL>
<DT> Base Mode

<DD> This mode is strictly singlethreaded and is what the library is
today, that is version 2.16pre2 (and 2.17 (unreleased, August 94).
The difference between this mode and the other two is basically that
all sockets are made blocking instead of non-blocking. The HTTP client
itself is the same as for the other modes and is basically a state
machine as described in the section on the <A
HREF="HTTPFeatures.html">Implementation of the HTTP Client</A>. The
mode is preserve compatibility with clients that use a singlethreaded
approach. This is also the mode used for the <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/Proxies/Proxies.html">CERN Proxy server</A>
using forking.  Currently this mode does not provide interruptable I/O
as this is a integral part of the event loop.

<DT> <A NAME="active">Active Mode</A>

<DD> In this mode the event loop (select-function) is placed in the
library. This is the easist way to get the multithreaded functionality
running. The mode can either be used by character based applications
with the keyboard as only user input, or if can be used by GUI
applications where the application register which sockets to look for
user events (mouse etc.). A different handler can be assigned for each
socket registered for user events. The user events have highest
priority in the event loop so that network I/O only is done when no
user events are pending. This guarantees a smooth operation on GUI
applications. A detailed description on how to use this mode is given
in <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTEvent.html">Library Event
Module</A>.

<DT> <A NAME="passive">Passive mode</A>

<DD> This is the mode that requires the most advanced client, for
example, a GUI client.  On every HTTP request from the client, the
library initiates the connection and as soon as it is ready for
reading or writing, it returns an updated list of active socket
descriptors used in the library to the client. When the client sees
that a socket is ready for action or it has been interrupted, it calls
a library socket-handler passing the socket number and what has to be
done. Then the socket handler finds the corresponding request and
executes the read, write or interrupt. As soon as the thread has to
access the network again, the socket handler stops and returns the
execution to the client. <P>

</DL>


<A NAME="#datastructures"><H2>Data Structures</H2></A>

The basic data structure for all requests to the library regardless of
the <A HREF="../../../Addressing/URL/4_1_Schemes.html">access
scheme</A> used is the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1"> HTRequest
structure</A>. This structure was introduced in the 2.15 release of
the library, but was a completely flat data model in the first
version. In version 2.16 and later, the request structure has turned
into a hierarchical data model in order to establish more clean
interfaces between the data structures in the library.<P>

As no automatic or global variables are available in this
implementation model every thread has to be state dependent and must
contain all necessary information in a separate data object. In order
to make a homogeneous interface to the HTRequest structure the new
protocol specific data structure <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#HTNetInfo">HTNetInfo</A> has
been defined. <P>

The definition of this data object is highly object oriented as every
protocol module in practice can define a sub class of the HTNetInfo
structure in order to add information necessary for completing a
thread. Again this is all done in plain C in order to maintain a high
degree of portability.

<A NAME="control"><H2>Control Flow</H2></A>

A consequence of having multiple threads in the library is that the
control flow changes to be an event driven flow where any action is
initiated by an event either caused by the user or the network
interface. The current implementation provides an allmost transparent
change in the client interface to the Library. The control flow as
illustrated in the <A HREF="Library.gif">control flow diagram</A> is
basically. In the case of an active mode implementation, an event-loop
has been added to the flow as illustrated below:

<P><IMG SRC="Internal.gif"><P>

If a protocol is not registered for non-blocking I/O, the only
difference is that there will be no call-back functions to the client
while serving the request.

The event loop is designed using event driven call back functions. As
indicated in the figure below, the event loop handles two kinds of
call back functions: the ones that are internal library functions such
as the loading function in the <A
HREF="../Guide/Protocol.html">protocol modules</A>, and the ones that
require an action taken by the client application.

<P><IMG SRC="EventLoop.gif"><P>

<H2>Interrupting a HTTP Request</H2>

When interrupting a network I/O operation, the application registers a
socket as interrupted and it will then be assigned the highest
priority among the registered sockets pending for network I/O (user
events still have <EM>the</EM> highest priority!) <P>
