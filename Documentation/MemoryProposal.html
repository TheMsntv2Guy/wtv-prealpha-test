<H1>WebTV Memory Management Proposal</H1>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<ABSTRACT><I>
This is a proposal for the final memory layout and management
for the first WebTV product.  It proposes a pointer-based scheme
with one single memory space (even for cached resources).
</I></ABSTRACT>

<P><BR><P><H2>Layout</H2>
Low memory addresses are reserved for CPU exception handlers and system globals.
Above this, are buffers reserved for sound, video, communications,
and any other reserved space.

<P>Following this is the dynamic allocation space referred to as
a <B>region</B>.  The region serves all of the dynamic memory
requests, both for cache and standard allocation requests.  The region
is separated into the heap and the cache.

<P>Above the region is room for a single processor stack, parameter
memory, and patch space.  All of this is dynamically sized at boot
time to reflect the amount of internal RAM and expansion RAM
(which is assumed adjacent).

<P>Memory within the heap is organized as a series of contiguous
blocks.  Some of these blocks are <B>free</B>, and are singly-linked
into a free list.  

<P>Others are <B>used</B>.  Used blocks maintain several fields in
the header:
<UL>
<LI><B>Length</B>:  The physical length of the block.
<LI><B>Underflow</B>:  The difference between physical and logical length.
The underflow is a small positive number.
<LI><B>Object number</B>:  An identifier that describes the c++ class of
the block, with additions for other well known objects.
</UL>

<P>All used and free blocks are at least 8 bytes large, in order
to accommodate the header fields.  Each block is a multiple of 4
bytes in length in order to avoid most alignment problems.

<P><BR><P><H2>Management</H2>

<P>All used blocks are locked into their particular locations
in memory, except at very well defined times.  Therefore, transient
problems with fragmentation may exist.

<P>However, this is greatly ameliorated because at idle time the
heap manager will compact the heap and readjust pointers within the
objects that refer to them.  It will handle this readjustments using
the following scheme:

<OL>
<B><LI></B>For c++ objects, dispatch off the class number and call the
appropriate version of the virtual function
<CODE>Boolean EachPointer(EachPointerFunction*, EachPointerParameters*)</CODE>.
<B><LI></B>For other objects, look at a pair of tables of entries in ROM or RAM that
have a 32 bit mask of where the pointers are in the object, as
longword offsets (which gives 128 bytes worth of pointer slots).  The
ROM table holds the first n entries, and the RAM table the rest, and
they are indexed into by the object number of each block.
<B><LI></B>We have a list of all globals that might point into the
heap, and adjust them as each block moves.
</OL>

<P><BR><P><H2>Usage</H2>

<P>This management technique allows the use of pointers, rather than
requiring the use of handles with its attendant issues (e.g.
stale pointers, 8 bytes/reference) and also avoid the issues with
back pointers.  By using this scheme we will have an easier time
importing new code and managing our code; the memory management
is centralized.

<P>But the downside is that we still accrue fragmentation during
long operations.  This can be lessened quite a bit if large blocks
were allocated immedaitely after idle.  The worst case comes when 
many small blocks are allocated, most of them are deleted (in no
particular order), and then a large block is requested.  Operations
should be factored to make this possible.

<P> When a large operation is requested then the single free block
is examined.  If too small then we request the cache to shrink by
the delta.
